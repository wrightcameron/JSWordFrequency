# Project JSWordFrequency

Author: Cameron Wright

## Overview
Reading JavaScript syntax and tutorials only gets you so far.  
I wanted to do a simple project in JavaScript so that I could start 
understanding the language better.  This program counts the word frequency 
for a given text file.

## Manifest

|Filename       | Description                                                       |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
|wf.js          | word frequency program                                            |
|README.md      | This file                                                         |
|Gettysburg-Address.txt| Textfile of the Gettysburg Address                         |

## Building the project

From the directory that this project is located run this command in either Linux terminal or Windows powershell.

$ node wf.js <text_file> 

The output is printed on the console.

## Features and usage

Summarize the main features of your program. It is also appropriate to instruct the 
user how to use your program.

## Testing

This section should detail how you tested your code. Simply stating "I ran it a few 
times and it seems to work" is not sufficient. Your testing needs to be detailed here 
or even better, this section should document the appropriate smoke/unit/system tests that you wrote.

### Known Bugs

List known bugs that you weren't able to fix (or ran out of time to fix).

## Discussion

Discuss the issues you encountered during development and testing. What problems 
did you have? What did you have to research and learn on your own? What kinds of 
errors did you get? How did you fix them?
